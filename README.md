# Erosion - Geometric Survival Strategy Game

A minimalist geometric survival strategy game that combines elements of bullet hell and tower defense genres. Players must strategically place structures while avoiding and managing enemy flows that behave like water currents.

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Movement System**: Enemies flow like water around obstacles, creating unique strategic challenges
- **Strategic Structure Placement**: Build walls, buildings, and towers based on overlap mechanics
- **Game State Counters**: Structures track a variety of game state parameters to generate interesting upgrades and challenges

- **Minimalist Geometric Design**: Clean, focused visual aesthetic
